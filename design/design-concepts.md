#Design Concepts

The theme for this assignment is based off the preamble that is titled "The Road to Enlightenment."  Therefore, I decided to use the 
theme of taking a road or a trail to a destination.  The image on the top of the screen will be a road or a trail that I hope to manipulate 
into cascading down the page by using the image itself or continuing the color schematics.  The inspiration came from http://www.csszengarden.com/150/.
Here you can see that this person has an image of a pier over a mass of water and I believe this personchanged the color background to match the color of the water..Here

I put the Road to Enlightment section in the center, so the user has a starting point.  The rest of the text I wanted to go in a zig-zag
route in order for the user to feel like he is on a road or a path some where.  I'm not sure what the empty boxes will be, maybe just 
some contrasting color.  I got the idea from http://www.csszengarden.com/174/, which he titled his zen garden as "Simple." I like how 
the simplicity and color schemes make the page visually easy to look at.  There are some impressive looking designs, but some of them have
too many things going on and it actually hurts the overall design.

The links to the right and left act like traffic barriers you see on the highway.
